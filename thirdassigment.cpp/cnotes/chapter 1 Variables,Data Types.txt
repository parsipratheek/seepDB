CHAPTER 1.VARIABLES DATA TYPES + INPUT/OUTPT: 
Variable is the name of a memory location which stores some data. 
EX:If i have 3 shoes that are kept in separate container/boxes these container are called as Variables.And the collection of containers are called DATA.(inside the container we have data and container called as Variable )


SOME RULES FOR VARIABLES: 
1. Variables are case sensitive means 
int:
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){}
 int age1 =18;
   printf("1.your age is %d\n",age1);  //printf gives output and inside the double quote " " that is called 'string',and %d is called as 'format specifier'.


 int number;
  printf("enter a number:");  
  scanf("%d",&number); // & is a address of a variable (number)   
  printf("2.your number is: %d\n",number); 


 int a,b;
  printf("enter a:");
  scanf("%d",&a);

  printf("enter b:");
  scanf("%d",&b);

  int sum=a+b;
  printf("3.sum is: %d\n",sum);


COMPILATION OR COMPILER:
A computer program that translates C code into machine code and computers dont understand c or c++ or java etc. computers only understand 0 or 1 ie. high or low voltage
This compiler is two step process first a flie (in this basic.c) is sent to c compiler; this compiler will check the code that there are errors there or not if there is no error this compiler will convert to a.exe(in this basic.exe) file  

Examples:
 1.Area of a square 
 int side;
  printf("enter side :");
  scanf("%d",&side);

  printf("4.area of a square is : %d\n", side*side);
