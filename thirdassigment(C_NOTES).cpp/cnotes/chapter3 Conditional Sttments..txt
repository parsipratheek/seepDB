CHAPTER 3. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS: 
 It allow programs to make decisions based on conditions. They control the flow of execution, enabling different code blocks to run depending on whether a condition is true or false.  
There are two types of conditional statements: •if,•if else,•else if,•switch


1.♦if condition: It is the simplest decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statements is executed otherwise not.     */
//Example: 
int i = 10;
    if (i < 18) {
        printf("Eligible for vote"); //if i<10 code will not generate 
    }


2.♦if else condition: It tells us that if a condition is true, it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false, it won’t. But what if we want to do something else when the condition is false? Here comes the C elsestatement.
We can use the elsestatement with the ifstatement to execute a block of code when the condition is false. The if-else statement consists of two blocks, one for false expression and one for true expression.
SNYTAX:
if(Condition) {
//do something if TRUE
}
else {
//do something if FALSE
}

EXAMPLE:
int marks;
printf("enter your marks:");
scanf("%d",&marks);
if(marks>18){
  printf("pass \n");          // BLOCK: A sequence of declarations, definitions, and statements enclosed within curly braces ({ }).
  printf("they can promote \n");
}
else {
  printf("fail \n");
}
printf("Thankyou\n");  //this thankyou will print everytime if the age is <18 or >18


3.♦ else if condition: It is a conditional statement used to test multiple conditions sequentially. It is an extension of the if statement and is often used in conjunction with the else statement to handle different scenarios   
SYNTAX:
if(Condition 1) {
//do something if TRUE
}
else if (Condition 2) {
//do something if 1st is FALSE & 2nd is TRUE 
}                                              
else {
//do something if FALSE
}

EXAMPLE:
int age2;
printf("enter your age:");
scanf("%d",&age2);

if(age2>18){
  printf("adult\n");
}
else if(age2>13 && age2 <=18){
  printf("teenager");
}
else{
  printf("child");
}

In the chapter 2 conditional insturutions in that opertaors (line 115,117)
-→f.TERNARY OPERATORS: It is similar to the if-else statement as it follows the same algorithm as of if-else statement but the ternary operator takes less space and helps to write the if-else statements in the shortest way possible 
SYNTAX: Condition ? doSomething if TRUE : doSomething;   (first we should add a condition '?' will check that it is true or not if it is false ':' will take that statment)

EXAMPLE:
int age3;
printf("enter your age3");
scanf("%d",&age3);
age3>=18 ? printf("adult\n") : printf("not adult\n");


4.♦ swtich condition: It provides an efficient way to transfer the execution to different parts of a code based on the value of the expression.               
SYNTAX:
switch(number) {          
case C1: //do something    
break;
case C2 : //do something
break;
default : //do something    (default is nothing but else condition and case 1,2.. is if ans if else condition, and you must keep break after cases)
}

EXAMPLE:
int day; //1-monday,2-tuesday,...
printf("enter day(1-7) :");
scanf("%d",&day);
switch (day){
  case 1 : printf("monday \n");
   break;
  case 2 : printf("tuesday \n");
   break;
  case 3 : printf("wednesday \n");
   break;
  case 4 : printf("thursday \n");
   break;
  case 5 : printf("friday \n");
   break;
  case 6 : printf("saturday \n");
   break;
  case 7 : printf("sunday \n");
   break;
  default : printf("not a day");
}


switch Properties : a. Cases can be in any order , b. Nested switch (switch inside switch) are allowed 
 Nested switch EXAMPLE :
int number2;
printf("enter number2 :");
scanf("%d" ,&number2);

if (number2>=0){
 printf("positive \n");
 if(number2 % 2 == 0){
    printf("even \n");
  } else {
    printf("odd \n");
  }
}else {
 printf("negative \n");     
 if(number2 % 2 == 0){
    printf("even \n");
  } else {
    printf("odd \n");
  }  
}
