CHAPTER 4: LOOP CONTORL STATMENTS:
It is the programe used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met. It allows programmers to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times without writing the code again and again.
There are 3 types of loop controls : 1.for looop, 2.while loop ,3. do while loop.This 3 loops will work same but there will be some difference in syntax


-→1. FOR LOOP: 
//syntax: 
for(initialisation; condition; updation) {                      
     //do something (it is same like if condition)
}                             
   (Initialisation means Initialize the variable to some initial value; Condition means This specifies the test condition. If the condition evaluates to true, then body of the loop is executed. If evaluated false, loop is terminated;if we dont write condition the code will become infinite loop.  
    Updation means After the execution loop’s body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value.)       */

//EXAMPLE:
for(int i=1; i<=5; i=i+1){ //i=i+1 or i++ or i+=1  and i is called as iterator or counter 
    printf("hello world");
    printf("%d",i); 
  }
for(char ch='a';ch<='z';ch++){
    printf("%c\n",ch);
  } 
  // In for loop we can use multiple conditions like
int n;
printf("enter number ");
scanf("%d",&n); 

int sum=0;
for(int i=1, j=n; i<=n && j>=1; i++, j--){
  sum=sum + i; 
  printf("%d\n",j);
}
printf("sum is %d \n",sum);    


INCREMENT OPERATOR:It is used to increment the value of a variable in an expression by 1. It can be used on variables of the numeric type. 
1.pre increment i++: It is the increment operator is used as the prefix. Also known as prefix increment, the value is incremented first according to the precedence and then the less priority operations are done.(means first it is increased and then use )
2.post increment ++i :It is the increment operator is used as the suffix of the operand. The increment operation is performed after all the other operations are done. It is also known as postfix increment.                                                   
There will be decrement operator opposite to increment operator.


-→2. WHILE LOOP: 
//SYNTAX: 
while(condition){
   //do something(here in while loop initialisation will be written first before writting while condition and condition will be written as same and updation will be written after the statement) 
}

1.EXAMPLE:
int i=1;
while(i<=5){
  printf("heyy");
  i++;
}
//2.EXAMPLE:
int n;
printf("enter number :");
scanf("%d",&n);
int i=0;
while(i<=n){
  printf("%d\n",i);
  i++;
}

 -→3.DO WHILE LOOP:
//SYNTAX:
do{
 //do something (here first we will write initialisation then we will print that and then updation and then condition 
}while(condition);
EXAMPLE:
int i=1;
do{
  printf("%d\n",i);
  i++;
}while(i<=7);

//QUESTION: Keep taking a number from usre as input until user enters odd number 
int n;
do{
   printf("enter a number :");
   scanf("%d\n",&n);
   printf("%d",n);
   if(n% 2 !=0) {
    break;
   }
}while(1);
return 0;
}


Break statement : It means exit the loop;(break;)
EXAMPLE:
int n;
do{
 printf("enter number :");
 scanf("%d",&n);
 printf("%d",n);
 if(n % 7==0){ //multiple of 7
      break;   (here if we enter any multiple of 7 the code will not run or generate)
   }
 }while(1); 


 Continue statement: It means skip to next iteration;(continue;)
EXAMPLE: see break example but here in the place of break we should write continue this helps us to stop that iteration at that point   
 (we can also say that it will skip that particular part only and then it will continue but in break it will totally stop that program)
